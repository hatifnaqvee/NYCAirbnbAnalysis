# NYCAirbnbAnalysis

Hello and welcome to my github page.
In this repository I have done some analysis on Airbnb data that is focusing on cost and affordability of Airbnb posting to hotel postings in NYC. This dataset intrigued me because there a lot of things you look at when you're travelling and NYC happens to be an expensive place to travel to. So, if you can cut costs anywhere and spend them on experiences, food, shopping, or anything else why shouldn't you. So, that is what my analysis is looking at.
